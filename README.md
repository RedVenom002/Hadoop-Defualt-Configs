# Hadoop_Defualt_Configs
This is the default setup for Hadoop. I got lazy and dont want to keep having to resetup Hadoop everytime so easy fix.


## What the config setup
The repo will setup all config hadoop files for simple Big Data applications and shouldn't be used for any real applicaiton.
Repo config setup: 
- Apache Hadoop 2.7
- Yarn *some version*
- 3 data replication
- Slave and Master List (**Assuming only One each**)

## What the configs dont setup
- Any communication between server and clients
- Java instalation (**setup assumes some defualt location**)
